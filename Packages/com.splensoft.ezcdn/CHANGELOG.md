# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.2] - 2024-05-06

### Added
- PrefabAutoUnloader and SceneAutoUnloader. These will automatically handle tracking and unloading asset bundles/master assets when an asset is no longer being used in the app. NOTE: This feature has not been extensively tested and is still in beta. There is no official documentation at this time, but if you want to test, please feel free! Do not ship any project to live with these features without understanding the risk. I will properly document them when they are tested properly and stable, and I will announce this in the changelog

- OnRetrievalStarted event in Prefab/Scene Requester. Useful for starting up progress bars (Thanks Sky!)

- Removed HTML documentation

### Fixes

- Fix null reference exception when an AssetImporter is null (not natively supported Unity asset) (Thanks Fay√ßal!)

## [1.3.1] - 2024-04-01

### Fixes

- Fix race condition when multiple dependency operations attempt to load the same asset bundle

## [1.3.0] - 2024-03-26

### Added
- Abstract class AssetBundleProcessor added. Can create inheriting classes that implement OnPreprocessAssetBundles for more editor scripting control 

## [1.2.0] - 2024-03-07

### Added
- IPreprocessAssetBundle interface added, following existing semantics in Unity. Implements OnPreprocessAssetBundle, which allows custom processing before the asset bundle is packaged and uploaded by EZ-CDN. IPreprocessAssetBundle should only be added to root-level components on prefabs or to ScriptableObjects that are managed by EZ-CDN (ManagedAsset attribute or added in Settings)
- Verbose option now available as a Log Level. Default is still Log
- AutoInstantiator ScriptableObject, which will automatically instantiate prefab asset bundles on app start
- MaxConcurrentDownloads option in settings
- Global events in AssetBundleManager - AssetRetrievalStarted, AssetLoaded, AssetBundleDownloadStarted, AssetBundleDownloadFinished, SceneAssetRetrievalStarted, SceneAssetLoaded. These are UnityEvents and will pass the asset bundle name as the argument

### Fixes
- Fix GUILayout issue with AssetBundleReferenceAttribute
- Add missing hookup to SceneRequester to download and load scene via an inspector event
- Change "Regenerate Asset Bundle Names" menu item to "Dry Run"

## [1.1.0] - 2024-03-04

### Added
- "Include Local Copy" option added in settings. Will include a new build of asset bundles in Streaming Assets when the app is built, and is used as a fall back when the app fails to get the asset bundle from the internet

## [1.0.1] - 2024-02-29
 
### Fixes
